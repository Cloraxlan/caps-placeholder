Interesting Nutrition Facts: 

- Asparagus is a good source of vitamins A, C and E, B-complex vitamins, potassium and zinc.

- An avocado has more than twice as much potassium as a banana.

- Celery is the best vegetable source of naturally occurring sodium.

- Kale contains lutein and zeaxanthin, which protect the eyes from macular degeneration.

- To increase the protein in peanut butter, Brewerâ€™s yeast can be mixed in - a useful tip for vegetarians.
